# WordCloudBusinessCard
I had an idea to use wordcloud designs for 
business cards, name tags and office signs. 
Not entirely novel I admit, but I decided to 
make a prototype using the R programming language
to practice and develop my coding skills. 
There is definitely room for improvement, 
but the code is working and if you are interested
in making something similar to the example pdf,
you should have no trouble adapting the code 
contained in the markdown file to your needs.
